# Counting_system_using_YOLOv8n
This project demonstrates real-time object detection, tracking, and unique object counting using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack. It detects objects from a live webcam feed (or video file), assigns persistent tracking IDs, and maintains per-class unique object counts across frames.
